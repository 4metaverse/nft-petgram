* Solidity: Solidity was used for the smart contract together with OpenZeppelin ERC721 for faster development of the smart contract

* Ganache: for local blockchain development

* Polygon, Matic Network: the network I deployed the app.

* Frontend: React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.
